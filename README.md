# Celeste grapple prototype
[Demo video](https://youtu.be/2UNkb18KWq8)

Conceived of as a hypothetical DLC for Celeste, where you play through Theo's journey up the 
moutain, using his grapple hook, since he doesn't have a dash. Explores a bunch of novel block types 
across a set of test levels.

Built back in 2020 using Gamemaker.
